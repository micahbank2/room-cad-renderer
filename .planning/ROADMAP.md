## v1.9 Polish & Feedback

**Goal:** Close v1.8 carry-over tech debt, ship two parked backlog features Jessica has already asked for, and gather real-use feedback to inform v2.0 scoping.

**Sequencing rationale:**
- **Phase 38** (POLISH-01) runs first — pure docs work, no dependency on Jessica's input. Closes AUDIT-01 carry-over.
- **Phase 39** (FEEDBACK-01) runs second — captures real-use friction BEFORE we commit deeper to ceiling resize / tile-size override. Output may reorder or replace Phases 40-41.
- **Phase 40** (CEIL-01) and **Phase 41** (TILE-01) run last — committed work but explicitly subject to Phase 39's feedback. If Jessica's pain points are elsewhere, these get bumped to v2.0+.

### Phase Details

#### Phase 38: VERIFICATION.md Backfill (AUDIT-01)
**Goal:** Phases 35, 36, 37 each gain a formal VERIFICATION.md that closes the v1.8 audit's AUDIT-01 carry-over.
**Depends on:** Nothing (pure docs work)
**Requirements:** POLISH-01
**UI hint:** no
**Plans:** TBD (est. 1 plan; reference existing SUMMARY + e2e + ROOT-CAUSE.md as substitute evidence — don't fabricate verification not actually performed)

#### Phase 39: Real-Use Feedback Session (FEEDBACK-01)
**Goal:** Capture Jessica's friction during a scheduled ~1-hour real-use session. Output is a ranked-priority document at `.planning/feedback/v1.9-jessica-session.md` that becomes the v2.0 scoping input.
**Depends on:** Nothing (independent of code phases)
**Requirements:** FEEDBACK-01
**UI hint:** no (process phase)
**Plans:** TBD (est. 1 plan; covers session prep, recording technique, debrief format, and Phase 35 HUMAN-UAT review folded in)

#### Phase 40: Ceiling Resize Handles (CEIL-01)
**Goal:** Ceilings can be drag-resized via edge handles like products and walls. Mirrors Phase 31 pattern.
**Depends on:** Phase 31 (drag-resize pattern + `widthFtOverride` / `depthFtOverride` schema + single-undo drag-transaction).
**Requirements:** CEIL-01
**UI hint:** yes
**Plans:** TBD (est. 1-2 plans; promote Phase 999.1 backlog. Subject to Phase 39 reordering)

#### Phase 41: Per-Surface Texture Tile-Size Override (TILE-01)
**Goal:** Each surface (floor / wall.wallpaper / ceiling) can have an optional per-placement texture tile-size override that scales the texture for design effect.
**Depends on:** Phase 34 (user-texture pipeline + RepeatWrapping math).
**Requirements:** TILE-01
**UI hint:** yes
**Plans:** TBD (est. 1-2 plans; promote Phase 999.3 / GH #105 backlog. Subject to Phase 39 reordering)

## Backlog

### Phase 999.1: Ceiling resize handles (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** [Captured for future planning] Extend drag-to-resize handles from Phase 31 (products + custom-elements) to cover ceilings. Ceilings (customElements with `kind: "ceiling"`) currently have no resize handles — users can only move or delete and redraw. Mirror Phase 31's width/depth override pattern (`widthFtOverride` / `depthFtOverride`, single-undo drag transaction, Alt disables smart-snap).

**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (promote with /gsd:review-backlog when ready)

**Discovered:** 2026-04-21 during Phase 32 T4 human UAT (Jessica) — pre-existing, not Phase 32 scope.

### Phase 999.2: Wallpaper + wallArt view-toggle regression — PROMOTED to Phase 36 under v1.8

Originally captured 2026-04-21 Phase 32 T4 human UAT. Promoted into v1.8 as Phase 36 (VIZ-10). See Phase 36 Details above.

### Phase 999.3: Per-surface texture tile-size override (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Let users scale a texture for design effect on a single surface without re-uploading. e.g., preview the same wood floor at 6"/12"/18" plank widths in the same room. Default behavior (real-world tiling via `RepeatWrapping`) stays correct; override is optional per surface.

**Requirements:** TBD
**GH Issue:** [#105](https://github.com/micahbank2/room-cad-renderer/issues/105)
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (promote with /gsd:review-backlog when ready, likely v1.9+ texture polish)

**Discovered:** 2026-04-25 during Phase 35 HUMAN-UAT — user asked why wood oak doesn't grow with the floor. Confirmed by-design behavior; captured as a natural follow-up enhancement. CLAUDE.md already flags "Texture tiling controls beyond real-world size" as out of scope for v1.8.
