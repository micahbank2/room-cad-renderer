## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: React 18 locked (R3F v8 + drei v9 compatibility — do not upgrade React)
- Init: Fabric.js for 2D, Three.js for 3D — both read from Zustand, neither mutates the other
- Init: Local-first, no backend — IndexedDB only

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: `fabricSync.ts` async image loading bug is the highest-priority fix (EDIT-09) — products show only border rectangle currently
- Phase 1: Full canvas redraw on every drag frame will degrade performance as rooms grow — address incrementally during Phase 1 work
- Phase 2: Global product library requires migrating from per-project IndexedDB to a shared store — serialization impact needs planning
- Phase 3: 3D export is currently broken (CSS selector finds wrong canvas element) — fix as part of SAVE-03 work
- All phases: No tests exist — geometry and store logic are high-risk areas without coverage
