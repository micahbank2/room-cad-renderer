# Room CAD Renderer — Project Context

## What This Is

A personal interior design tool built for Jessica (Micah's wife) to plan and visualize their future home. She uploads products she actually loves — from Pinterest, specific stores, real items she's considering — places them in dimensionally accurate multi-room layouts, and walks through the space in 3D at eye level before buying anything.

This is a single-user personal tool. Not a SaaS, not a professional CAD app, not a collaboration platform.

## Core Value

**Jessica can see her future room with her actual furniture before spending money.** The magic moment: she uploads a photo of a couch she found, places it in a room with real dimensions, switches to walk mode, and feels whether it works.

## Current State

**v1.3 shipped 2026-04-06.** Full paint system (132 Farrow & Ball + custom hex), lime wash finish, bulk painting via multi-select, custom element edit handles, collapsible sidebars, unified surface material catalog. 12/16 requirements shipped; 4 polish items (wainscot inline edit, copy-side, frame override, sidebar verification) landed as code but deferred formal verification to v1.4.

**v1.2 shipped 2026-04-05.** 29 requirements across 7 phases. Ceilings, floor materials, wallpaper, wall art, wainscoting, crown molding, custom element builder, framed art library, 7 wainscoting styles, per-side wall treatments.

**v1.1 shipped 2026-04-05.** 21 UX fixes across 6 phases. Zoom/pan, click accuracy, tool auto-revert, live dimensions, wall rotation, product resize, corner-perfect walls, edit handles, save status, welcome screen.

**v1.0 shipped 2026-04-05.** 14 requirements. Product library → 2D plans → 3D rendering → walkthrough → export → auto-save.

See `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for links to each milestone archive.

## Current Milestone: v1.4 Polish & Tech Debt

**Goal:** Close all deferred v1.3 verification gaps and clean up UI label formatting.

**Target features:**
- Wainscot inline edit — double-click to change style/height in place (POLISH-02)
- Copy wall treatment to opposite side (POLISH-03)
- Frame style override per wall art piece (POLISH-04)
- Sidebar scroll verification — ensure all panels scroll correctly (POLISH-06)
- Remove all underscores from UI labels (UI cleanup)

## Target User

One person. Non-technical. Interior design enthusiast, not a professional. Comfortable with basic computer use. Thinks visually. Saves products from Pinterest, Instagram, and store websites.

## Context

- Building a home — this is for planning real purchases
- Existing tools fail because they lock you into preset catalogs or are too complex
- Jessica wants HER products in HER rooms at the right scale
- "Feel the space" matters as much as "does it fit"
- Desktop-first (laptop/monitor). iPad is future wishlist, not v1.
- Codebase is ~13,300 LOC TypeScript across React 18 + Fabric.js + Three.js + Zustand

### Active

v1.4 requirements — see `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`

### Out of Scope

- Multi-user / collaboration — single user only
- Export to contractors / CAD file formats — not needed
- Pricing integration / shopping lists — not for this product
- Mobile / iPad support — desktop only for now, iPad on v2 wishlist
- Professional drafting features (layers, annotations, blueprints)
- Backend / server / auth — stays local-first (IndexedDB)
- GLTF/OBJ 3D model upload — too complex for Jessica's workflow, stick with images

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Local-first, no backend | Single user, personal tool. IndexedDB sufficient. | ✓ Good — no sync headaches, instant saves |
| Global product library | Jessica uploads once, uses across all projects. | ✓ Good — shipped as productStore separate from cadStore |
| Image-only products (no required 3D models) | Jessica saves screenshots from Pinterest/stores. | ✓ Good — textured boxes read as realistic enough |
| Optional dimensions | Some products she wants to see in the space — vibes over precision. | ✓ Good — placeholder dash works in 2D and 3D |
| Desktop-only | Laptop workflow. iPad can come later. | ✓ Good — no responsive compromises |
| React 18 (not 19) | R3F 8 + drei 9 had hook errors with React 19. | Locked — do not upgrade |
| Obsidian CAD design system (DS8) | Dark theme, purple accents, monospace labels. | Locked |
| Fabric.js for 2D, Three.js for 3D | Both read from same Zustand store. | Locked — clean one-way data flow |
| CADSnapshot v2 with migration | Multi-room needed wrapping shape; v1 → v2 migrateSnapshot. | ✓ Good — backwards-compatible |
| active-room selector pattern | Single null-guard call-site per action. | ✓ Good — 15 consumers wired cleanly |
| History-boundary drag pattern | One snapshot at mousedown, no-history per frame. | ✓ Good — smooth drags without history bloat |
| Module-level async caches (image/texture/floor) | Dedup concurrent loads, naturally dedup via Promise-valued cache. | ✓ Good — no double-fetch bugs |
| react-colorful for paint picker | Lightweight hex picker, no heavy deps. | ✓ Good — clean integration |
| Unified surface material catalog | One data file serves both floor and ceiling pickers. | ✓ Good — reduced duplication |
| Floor texture clone pattern | Clone cached texture, share source — independent repeat per consumer. | ✓ Good — split-view safe |
| Paint mutual exclusion (paintId clears surfaceMaterialId) | Single material state per ceiling, no ambiguous combos. | ✓ Good — clean UX |
| CollapsibleSection as file-scoped component | Only Sidebar uses it, no need for shared component. | ✓ Good — minimal surface area |

## Tech Stack (Current)

- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite 8
- Fabric.js v6 (2D CAD canvas)
- Three.js via @react-three/fiber v8 + drei v9 (3D viewport, walk mode via PointerLockControls)
- Zustand v5 + Immer (cadStore + uiStore + productStore + projectStore, undo/redo, auto-save)
- Tailwind CSS v4 (styling, Obsidian CAD theme inline in index.css)
- idb-keyval (IndexedDB persistence — projects + product library)
- Vitest + jsdom + @testing-library (115 tests + 3 todo)
- IBM Plex Mono + Space Grotesk + Inter (typography)
- Material Symbols Outlined (icons)

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
