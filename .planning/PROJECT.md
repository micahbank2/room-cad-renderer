# Room CAD Renderer — Project Context

## What This Is

A personal interior design tool built for Jessica (Micah's wife) to plan and visualize their future home. She uploads products she actually loves — from Pinterest, specific stores, real items she's considering — places them in dimensionally accurate multi-room layouts, and walks through the space in 3D at eye level before buying anything.

This is a single-user personal tool. Not a SaaS, not a professional CAD app, not a collaboration platform.

## Core Value

**Jessica can see her future room with her actual furniture before spending money.** The magic moment: she uploads a photo of a couch she found, places it in a room with real dimensions, switches to walk mode, and feels whether it works.

## Current State

**v1.1 shipped 2026-04-05.** 21 UX fixes across 6 phases. The app is
usable without workarounds — zoom + pan, click accuracy, tool auto-
revert, live dimensions, wall rotation, product resize, corner-perfect
wall rendering, edit handles for every placed element, prominent save
status, focused welcome screen, upload-a-floor-plan tracing.

**v1.0 shipped 2026-04-05.** 14 requirements. The core loop works:
global product library → dimensionally accurate 2D floor plans →
textured 3D rendering → eye-level walkthrough → PNG export → auto-
saved + restored on reload.

See `.planning/MILESTONES.md` for all shipped work.

## Target User

One person. Non-technical. Interior design enthusiast, not a professional. Comfortable with basic computer use. Thinks visually. Saves products from Pinterest, Instagram, and store websites.

## Context

- Building a home — this is for planning real purchases
- Existing tools fail because they lock you into preset catalogs or are too complex
- Jessica wants HER products in HER rooms at the right scale
- "Feel the space" matters as much as "does it fit"
- Desktop-first (laptop/monitor). iPad is future wishlist, not v1.
- Codebase is ~8,600 LOC TypeScript across React 18 + Fabric.js + Three.js + Zustand

### Active (v1.2 New Element Types)

**Ceilings:**
- [ ] Draw ceiling polygons with editable height + material (CEIL-01/02/03/04)

**Floor materials:**
- [ ] Preset catalog + custom texture upload + scale/rotation controls (FLOOR-01/02/03)

**Wall surfaces:**
- [ ] Per-wall wallpaper (SURFACE-01)
- [ ] Wall art items at x/y positions per wall (SURFACE-02/03/04)

**Architectural trim:**
- [ ] Per-wall wainscoting toggle with editable height (TRIM-01)
- [ ] Per-wall crown molding toggle (TRIM-02)
- [ ] 3D rendering of both trim types (TRIM-03)

**Custom element builder:**
- [ ] Create custom items (name, shape, dims, material) (CUSTOM-01)
- [ ] Place, move, rotate, resize on canvas (CUSTOM-02/03)
- [ ] Render in 3D (CUSTOM-04)
- [ ] Per-project catalog for re-placement (CUSTOM-05)

### Planned (v1.2 New Element Types)
- Ceilings
- Editable floors
- Wallpaper & wall art (wall surface overlays)
- Wainscoting + crown molding presets
- Freeform custom-element builder

### Planned (v1.3 Color & Paint System)
- Color/paint library (global)
- Farrow & Ball catalog (~130 colors)
- Custom color creation + save
- Lime wash toggle (filter/shader)
- Apply paint to walls + ceilings (2D + 3D)

### Out of Scope

- Multi-user / collaboration — single user only
- Export to contractors / CAD file formats — not needed
- Pricing integration / shopping lists — not for this product
- Mobile / iPad support — desktop only for now, iPad on v2 wishlist
- Professional drafting features (layers, annotations, blueprints)
- Backend / server / auth — stays local-first (IndexedDB)
- GLTF/OBJ 3D model upload — too complex for Jessica's workflow, stick with images

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Local-first, no backend | Single user, personal tool. IndexedDB sufficient. | ✓ Good — no sync headaches, instant saves |
| Global product library | Jessica uploads once, uses across all projects. | ✓ Good — shipped as productStore separate from cadStore |
| Image-only products (no required 3D models) | Jessica saves screenshots from Pinterest/stores. | ✓ Good — textured boxes read as realistic enough |
| Optional dimensions | Some products she wants to see in the space — vibes over precision. | ✓ Good — placeholder dash works in 2D and 3D |
| Desktop-only | Laptop workflow. iPad can come later. | ✓ Good — no responsive compromises |
| React 18 (not 19) | R3F 8 + drei 9 had hook errors with React 19. | Locked — do not upgrade |
| Obsidian CAD design system (DS8) | Dark theme, purple accents, monospace labels. | Locked |
| Fabric.js for 2D, Three.js for 3D | Both read from same Zustand store. | Locked — clean one-way data flow |
| CADSnapshot v2 with migration | Multi-room needed wrapping shape; v1 → v2 migrateSnapshot. | ✓ Good — backwards-compatible |
| active-room selector pattern | Single null-guard call-site per action. | ✓ Good — 15 consumers wired cleanly |
| History-boundary drag pattern | One snapshot at mousedown, no-history per frame. | ✓ Good — smooth drags without history bloat |
| Module-level async caches (image/texture/floor) | Dedup concurrent loads, naturally dedup via Promise-valued cache. | ✓ Good — no double-fetch bugs |

## Next Milestone Goals

v1.2 New Element Types — expand beyond walls + products to cover the architectural and decorative elements that make a room feel real.

Key decisions locked in during scoping:
- **Ceilings**: per-ceiling polygon with custom shape (flexible, supports future vaulted bits)
- **Floors**: preset material catalog + custom texture upload
- **Wall surfaces**: per-wall wallpaper + wall art placed with x/y/size
- **Trim**: per-wall toggles for wainscoting + crown molding (matches real construction)
- **Custom elements**: full 3D rendering with box/plane shapes

After v1.2: v1.3 adds the color & paint system with Farrow & Ball catalog and lime wash.

## Tech Stack (Current)

- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite 8
- Fabric.js v6 (2D CAD canvas)
- Three.js via @react-three/fiber v8 + drei v9 (3D viewport, walk mode via PointerLockControls)
- Zustand v5 + Immer (cadStore + uiStore + productStore + projectStore, undo/redo, auto-save)
- Tailwind CSS v4 (styling, Obsidian CAD theme inline in index.css)
- idb-keyval (IndexedDB persistence — projects + product library)
- Vitest + jsdom + @testing-library (115 tests + 3 todo)
- IBM Plex Mono + Space Grotesk + Inter (typography)
- Material Symbols Outlined (icons)

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
